## Background

This repository contains a small project centered on web-scraping and data analysis. This project is broken into two sections: (1) Scraping titles and previewing text from Mars news articles, and (2) Scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from a table. The process involves identifying HTML elements on a page through their id and class attributes, and extracting this information via both automated browisng with Splinter and HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup.
